## Run and set up the app locally

When you have completed the first step you should have the app github repo cloned to your local machine and npm installed.

1. Go to the directory of the app and start it

```bash
cd otel-workshop/src/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. If all the steps above complete successfully you should now be able to review the app running at http://localhost:3000 

## Customize your app instance

In order to find the data from your app instance in Grafana you have to change the instrumentation ID of your app.

1. Open the file:

```bash
otel-workshop/src/frontend/src/otel/instrumentation.client.ts
```

Find this section (around L21)

```js
  const resource = new Resource({
    [ATTR_SERVICE_NAME]: 'otel-workshop-client',
    [ATTR_SERVICE_VERSION]: '0.1.0',
  });
```

2. Change the "ATTR_SERVICE_NAME" to any name you like

## View your app data in Grafana
