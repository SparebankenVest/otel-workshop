## Find out why your app is failing in the backend dashboard

We have now enabled full logging and tracing for our application. It turns out the API was written by some very mediocre developers, leading to a very high rate of failed requests. Luckily for us we now have full insight in the application and determining the root cause of these erros should be a breeze.

1. In your application, do some browsing until you see a failed request in your developer tools network tab.

2. Click the failed request to see the headers sent for this request

3. Extract the middle part of the Traceparent Header 
4. Go to the [backend dashboard](https://grafana.svai.dev/d/eec0xeesocruoc/svai-dashboard-backend) in Grafana
5. Filter the dashboard using the Trace ID Filter. Insert the Trace ID you extracted on the previous step. See if you can find the root cause of your error.
