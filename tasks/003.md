## Create your own metric and explore it in grafana

1. In the code you can find different metric counters, here are some examples

```bash
src/frontend/src/app/fact/page.tsx
```

```js
  const typingDuration = meter.createHistogram('fact.typing.duration', {
    description: 'Time spent typing a fact',
  });
```

```bash
src/frontend/src/app/page.tsx
```

```js
    const emojiCounter = meter.createCounter('emoji.count.total', {
      description: 'Total number of emojis displayed',
    });
```

2. The OTEL Metrics API meter operations support multiple types of metrics/operations [link](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/api/#meter-operations)
3. Create your own metric in the app that measures something you want to measure.
4. When you have added the required code in the app, go to [Grafana](https://grafana.svai.dev)
5. Go to the Explore menu, but this time select `Prometheus`as your data source, look for your metric name in the metric explorer dropdown.
6. After you have selected your metric name, press the <img src="image-2.png" alt="drawing" width="20"/> icon in the upper right corner
